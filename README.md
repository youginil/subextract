# subextract

Extracting subtitle (hard-encoded) from video

## Requirements

- Python
- ffmpeg and ffprobe
- [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) [Optional]
- [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) [Optional]

## Post-recognization

The result maybe not accurate, you can correct it manually by subtitle editor, such as [Aegisub](https://github.com/Aegisub/Aegisub), or improve it through changing models.

- Add more options to scripts
